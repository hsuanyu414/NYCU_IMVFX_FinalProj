# NYCU_IMVFX_FinalProj

## Introduction
This is the final project of NYCU IMVFX course.

The goal of this project aim to streamline the image composition process by developing an efficient tool. 

This tool simplifies the user experience by automating the generation of trimaps, a crucial component in image matting.

For more information, please refer the report in the `report` folder.

## Code
For the code, please refer to the `code` folder.
